# ShoppingList

The goal here is to have a webapp that can be used to build a shopping list in a collaboratively way, and when one of the people is effectively in the store doing the shopping, the other can see in real time what is bought.

## Usage
You first need to start a mock database using the following command:
```
json-server db-test.json
```

And then you start the application using:
```
ng serve
```
